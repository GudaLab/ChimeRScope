# Welcome to the ChimeRScope©️ wiki!
ChimeRScope is a java application (distributed as JAR file) that uses a novel alignment-free approach for discovering fusion genes from transcriptome-sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets. Prediction results from simulated datasets and real datasets show that our method achieves the best prediction accuracy, comparing to all other popular methods.
# ChimeRScope advantages

    Easy to install and configure.

    Set up Java Runtime Environment 7 or higher and download several files and you are good to go.

    Works on other species as well.

    Many other tools are hard to configure for non-human species.

    Serves as a branch pipeline for regular RNA-seq data analysis pipeline (Toxedo pipeline).

    Only analyze unmapped reads from Tuxedo pipeline.

    Graphical User Interface for easier result interpretation.

    ChimeRScope offers SVG outputs. We also provides wrapper scripts for ChimeRScope Galaxy server version.
